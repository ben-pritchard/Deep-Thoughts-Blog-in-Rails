###DESCRIPTION

This is a Ruby on Rails blogging app focused on collecting deep thoughts.

Deep thoughts **only!** (e.g. I'm hungry.)

**Beware**: things that don't work yet:

  Rspec completely crapped out on me and just hangs when I run it (even when I tried rolling back to this morning when rspec was working)

###SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

To set up your server from your terminal, go to your project directory and enter `rails s`

Make sure postgres is running by going to your terminal and running `postgres`

Then go to localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

Or check it out on heroku: https://deep-thoughts-blog.herokuapp.com/
